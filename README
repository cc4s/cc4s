====== Coupled Cluster for Solids ======

===== Library dependencies =====
  * go to the lib subdirectory and execute:
  make [CONFIG=<config>] [Options]
  * this should automatically fetch the submodules' source from the respective maintainers, configure the modules for the given configuration (See below) and build the modules for that configuration.
  * by default the configuration ''icc'' is used.

===== Building =====
  * check gcc version. Need at least gcc 4.7.2 (As tested, gcc 4.6 does not work).
  * write or edit a ''config.<config>'' file for your build environment.
  * the configuration files ''config.gxx'' and ''config.icc'' contain predifined retail environments for ''gxx'' and ''icc'', respectively, using full optimization and without debugging info.
  * for the gxx configuration the following additional libraries are required
    ** blacs-openmpi
    ** lapack-openmpi
    ** blacsCinit-openmpi
    ** scalapack-openmpi
  * make sure, ctf is built for your configuration
  * run ''make -j 8 [CONFIG=<config]>'' to build for the desired environment, by default for ''icc''. The ''-j'' option issues a parallel make on 8 processes.
  * run ''make install [CONFIG=<config>]'' to copy the executable to the specified target directory. The default is ''~/bin/cc4s/<config>''.
  * the intermediate build files for each build environment can be found in the directory ''build/<config>/''

===== Running =====
  * a ''cc4s'' operation file, e.g. ''mp2.cc4s'', can be run with ''~/bin/cc4s/icc/Cc4s -file mp2.cc4s''.

===== Testing =====

==== Running tests ====

  * run the test suite in the test directory:
    ./test.sh [-c <config>] [-t <type>] [...]
    You can run
    ./test.sh -h
    to see all the available options.
  * this issues all tests of the given type for local build binary of the given build environment.
  * by default the ''essential'' tests are conducted for the ''icc'' build binary.
  * note that installed executables are not tested unless you explicitly specify their location, e.g. by:
  ./test.sh -x ~/bin/cc4s/gxx/Cc4s

==== Writing tests ====

  * To write a test you need to write a bash script with the name "doTest.sh"
    in a suitable location. There is no restriction in the location as long
    it is in the folder "test".
  * To define different groups of tests a CLASS attribute is provided.
    All tests are by default in the class "all", and all important tests should
    be in the class "essential". The class of the test is defined by writing
    in the header of the test file the line:
    # @CLASS=essential,example_class1,....
  * A convention to follow is that the essential corresponds to the test file
    in the main parent directory of every test case. Subdirectories can
    allways be created containing also test files, which should typically
    marked as non-essential.
  * To every test script global variables are made available by the test suite
    script "test.sh". These are "RUN_COMMAN" and "CC4S_PATH".  RUN_COMMAND is
    meant to be either empty or a form of mpi runner (e.g. mpirun).  CC4S_PATH
    is the path of the cc4s executable. You can run the test
    calculation by writing for example in the test script:
    ${RUN_COMMAND} ${CC4S_PATH} -file test.cc4s
  * The main task of the test script is to set a variable upon termination to communicate
    if the test was succesful or not. This varible is TEST_RESULT. A value of 0 means
    that the test was succesful. Otherwise the test suite will consider the
    test as failed.    You can write other programs or scripts in order to
    decide if the test was successful or not, but the result must be
    communicated by setting these variables in the doTest.sh script.
  * In order to print debug information during the implementation of the test,
    you can write to stderr since stdout is being overriden by the test suite
    runner. You can do this like so
    echo "Debug message" >&2



===== Update to newer module versions =====

If any of the submodules are updated by their respective maintainer, you
can incorporate the latest version into cc4s. Note that this
may lead to incompatabilities and it must therefore be done with good care.
  * if you intent to update the master, create a branch from the master. In case anything goes wrong the damage is controlled
  * update the modules at the top level of the cc4s directory structure:
  git submodule foreach git pull origin master
  * build the updated modules for all configurations supported as described above.
  * build ''cc4s'' for all configurations supported
  * run the ''cc4s'' ''essental'' tests for all configurations supported
  * fix all bugs that emerged from advancing to the new version in ''cc4s'' or let them be fixed in the modules.

If all tests pass, ''cc4s'' may be advanced to the new modules' versions  by
  git commit -m "Updated submodules to latest version"
  * if you want to advance the master branch, merge your branch into it.

Note that you may commit changes to the your branch even if things do not work. However, each commit will be visible in the history.
