* Writing tests

A test case consists of a folder with a =test.json=
file in it.

A valid =test.json= file is one that has the following fields

| Name        | default      | Description                                |
|-------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------|
| name        | ""           | Name of the test                           |
| resources   | []           | Resources to be linked into the directory  |
|             |              | as a data dependency for the test          |
| description | ""           | A description of the test                  |
| tags        | ""           | Tags of the test, e.g., ="essential base"= |
| run         | "./run.py"   | Script to run to perform the test          |
| check       | "./check.py" | Script to run to perform the checking      |
|             |              | of the run phase.                          |

Every resouce has the fields
- out :: Where is the file going to be copied in the test directory.
- uri :: The =uri= of the resource. Here the name of a source
  appearing in =sources.json= can be included in brackets ={}=
  and it will be included accordingly. Refere to the sources file
  documentation for more information.


* The sources file

The source file describes the sources that are predefined for the test case
to get the data from the internet or from a local path.

A resource is composed of the following fields:

- uri ::
  Which is an identifier of the path of the sources, it can be an url
  or a local path.
- type ::
  The type of resource for =testis= to know how to deal with it.

The =type= can be one of the following keywords

- raw ::
  A raw source will be copied directly to the uri of the test case,
  i.e., if =user-manual= is defiend as
  #+begin_src json
  "user-manual" {
      "uri": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc4s/user-manual/master/data/",
      "type": "raw"
  }
  #+end_src
  then if a test case uses
  #+begin_src json
  {
      "out": "script.sh",
      "uri": "{user-manual}/script.sh"
  }
  #+end_src
  then =uri= will be rendered as taking the =uri= of =user-data= and pasting it
  in place.
- zip ::
  A zip file to be downloaded, extracted and its contents to be linked
  individually.
- tar ::
  A tar file to be downloaded, extracted and its contents to be linked
  individually. Bear in mind that =tar= and =tar.gz= and usual
  formats are supported under the same *tar* type.
  For more information check the =tarfile= python package documentation [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html?highlight=tar#module-tarfile][here]].

** Example getting sources from all types

This example shows all the ways that there are to declare resources for a test
from predefined source aliases.

#+headers: :tangle ./tests/testis/test.json :mkdirp t
#+begin_src json
{
    "name": "Testis test",
    "resources": [
        {
            "out": "script.sh",
            "uri": "{user-manual-master}/run-simple-lih.sh",
            "_comment": "test raw"
        }, {
            "out": "again.sh",
            "uri": "{user-manual-master-zip}/data/run-simple-lih.sh",
            "_comment": "test zip"
        }, {
            "out": "Aluminium",
            "uri": "{ppl-supporting-information}/f12dz_gamma1.0/Al",
            "_comment": "test downloading from zenodo"
        }, {
            "out": "Aluminium",
            "uri": "{ppl-supporting-information-github-v1-2}/f12dz_gamma1.0/Al",
            "_comment": "test downloading a tar file"
        }
    ],
    "tags": "essential infrastructure"
}
#+end_src

where the sources ahve been defined to be as

#+begin_src json
{

    "user-manual-master": {
        "uri": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc4s/user-manual/master/data/",
        "type": "raw"
    },

    "user-manual-master-zip": {
        "uri": "https://github.com/cc4s/user-manual/archive/refs/heads/master.zip",
        "type": "zip"
    },

    "ppl-supporting-information": {
        "uri": "https://zenodo.org/record/4597520/files/alejandrogallo/ppl-supporting-information-v1.2.zip?download=1",
        "type": "zip"
    },

    "ppl-supporting-information-github-v1-2": {
        "uri": "https://github.com/cc4s/ppl-supporting-information/archive/refs/tags/v1.2.tar.gz",
        "type": "tar"
    }


}
#+end_src

* Writing checks
- Every test has to include a reference
  yaml output that has been manually validated.
